# Enhanced Strategic Decision-Making through Customer Segmentation and Customer Churn Prediction: A Data-Driven Approach to Dynamic Market Positioning with Big Data Technologies

## Overview
A practical implementation of big data technologies and frameworks.
This project explores the deployment of Apache Hadoop ecosystems in handling large-scale analytical workflows and incorporates machine learning models for actionable insights.
Analytics demonstrated through a customer segmentation study case.

## Data
Sources:

- [src1]()
- [src2]()

The datasets contain the transactional records for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.
They are chosen for their extensive customer interaction data and high volume, allowing for effective demonstration of big data analytics.

## Core Implementation

- Apache Spark processing engine
- Apache Spark MLlib for distributed machine learning
- Scalable data pipeline optimization
- Integration with the Hadoop ecosystem
- Web-based interface for data visualization and interaction (optional)
